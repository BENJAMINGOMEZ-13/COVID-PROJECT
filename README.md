## Introduction

This project is an exploration of COVID-19 data using SQL. It involves analyzing COVID-19 data from a relational database, performing various SQL operations, and creating views for later data visualization.

## Project Description

The project aims to provide insights into COVID-19 data, focusing on various aspects such as total cases, deaths, population, vaccination rates, and more. The SQL queries and data transformations in this project enable the extraction of valuable information for further analysis.

## Skills Used

- SQL
- Joins
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Temporary Tables
- Window Functions
- Aggregate Functions
- Creating Views
- Converting Data Types

## SQL Queries

The project includes several SQL queries that analyze COVID-19 data, including:

- Retrieving COVID-19 data for locations with continents.
- Analyzing the likelihood of death if one contracts COVID-19.
- Calculating the percentage of the population infected with COVID-19.
- Identifying countries with the highest infection rates compared to their populations.
- Finding countries with the highest death count per population.
- Breaking down data by continent and showing continents with the highest death count per population.
- Providing global numbers, including total cases, total deaths, and death percentages.
- Analyzing the percentage of the population that has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine.
