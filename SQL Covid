-- Selecting the data we need

Select Location, Date, Total_Cases, New_Cases, Total_Deaths, Population
From Project..CovidD
Where Continent is not null
Order by 1,2




-- Analyzing Total Cases vs Total Deaths
-- This shows us the chances of dying if Covid is contracted in that particular country

Select Location, Date, Total_Cases, Total_Deaths, (Total_Deaths/Total_Cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
From Project..CovidD
Where Location like '%India%' and Continent is not null
Order by 1,2




-- Analyzing Total Cases vs Population 
-- This shows us the percentage of the population that is infected with Covid

Select Location, Date, Total_Cases, Population_Density, (Total_Cases/Population)*100 as PopulationInfectedPercent
From Project..CovidD
Order by 1,2




-- Analyzing countries with the highest infection rate compared to population

Select Location, Population, MAX(Total_Cases) as HighestInfectionCount, Max((Total_Cases/Population))*100 as PopulationInfectedPercent
From Project..CovidD
Group by Location, Population
Order by PopulationInfectedPercent desc




-- Analyzing countries with highest death count per population

Select Location, MAX(cast(Total_Deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount
From Project..CovidD
Where Continent is not null
Group by Location
Order by TotalDeathCount desc  




-- Analyzing by continent
-- This shows us the continents with the highest death count per population

Select Continent, MAX(cast(Total_Deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount

Group by Continent
Order by TotalDeathCount desc  




-- Analyzing global numbers

Select SUM(New_Cases) as Total_cases, SUM(cast(New_Deaths as int)) as Total_deaths, SUM(cast(New_Deaths as int))/SUM(New_Cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
From Project..CovidD
Where Continent is not null
